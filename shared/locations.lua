--[[	LIST OF POSSIBLE VEHICLE MODIFIERS   ]]--
-- Using these will change how each vehicle spawns
-- This can be used for making sure the vehicles comes out exactly how you want it to

-- CustomName = "Police Car", this will show a custom override name for your vehicles so you don't need to add them to your vehicles.lua
-- rank = { 2, 4 }, -- This specifes which grades can see it, and only these grades
-- grade = 4, -- This specifies the lowest grade and above that can see the vehicle
-- colors = { 136, 137 }, -- This is the colour index id of the vehicle, Primary and Secondary in that order
-- bulletproof = true, -- This determines if the tyres are bullet proof (don't ask me why, I was asked to add this)
-- livery = 1, -- This sets the livery id of the vehicle, (most mod menus would number them or have them in number order) 0 = stock
-- extras = { 1, 5 }, -- This enables the selected extras on the vehicle
-- performance = "max", this sets the stats to max if available
-- performance = { 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, true }, -- This allows more specific settings for each upgrade level, in order: engine, brakes, suspension, transmission, armour, turbo
-- trunkItems = { }, -- Use this to add items to the trunk of the vehicle when it is spawned

-- ANY VEHICLE, BOATS, POLICE CARS, EMS VEHICLES OR EVEN PLANES CAN BE ADDED.
